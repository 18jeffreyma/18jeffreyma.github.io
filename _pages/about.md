I'm currently a undergraduate at the California Institute of Technology
studying Computer Science and BEM (Business, Economics, and Management).

Interests
------
I'm generally interested in machine learning, computer vision, and network
design. I specifically enjoy studying how computer science intersects with
other fields, whether it be medical imaging or game theory, and I'm always
excited to work on projects that combine aspects from multiple disciplines.

Research
------
Currently, I'm working with [Anima Anandkumar](http://tensorlab.cms.caltech.edu/users/anima/),
[Yuanyuan Shi](http://shiyuanyuan.site/), and [Florian Schafer](https://f-t-s.github.io/) to
extend the two player Competitive Gradient Descent and Competitive Mirror Descent
algorithms to a multi-agent, reinforcement learning setting.

Previously, I've worked at the [Magnetic Resonance Systems Research Laboratory](https://mrsrl.sites.stanford.edu/)
at Stanford University under [Shreyas Vasanawala](https://profiles.stanford.edu/shreyas-vasanawala) and
[Ukash Nakarmi](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ukashnakarmi), working on the
development of a deep-learning framework to detect motion artifacting in
pediatric MRI and provide data informed suggestions to MR technicians.

I've also worked at [The Wall Lab](https://wall-lab.stanford.edu/) at Stanford University,
under [Dennis Wall](https://profiles.stanford.edu/dennis-wall) and
[Nick Haber](https://ed.stanford.edu/faculty/nhaber) on developing a
machine-learning classifier for the diagnosis of Autism Spectrum Disorder
based on a patientâ€™s accuracy in emotional recognition and level of facial engagement.


Work Experience
------
I've also previously interned at Google Brain as a Software Engineering Intern on the
[TensorFlow Extended](https://www.tensorflow.org/tfx) team, working on an
end-to-end platform to automatically train and deploy ML models in production.

This coming Spring, I will be working as a Software Engineering Intern at
[Nuro](https://nuro.ai/about), and this coming Summer, I'll be interning at
[Citadel](https://www.citadel.com/about-citadel/) also as a Software Engineering
Intern.
