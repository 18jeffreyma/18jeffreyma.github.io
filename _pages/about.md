I'm currently a undergraduate at the California Institute of Technology studying
in Computer Science and BEM (Business, Economics, and Management).

Interests
------
I'm generally interested in machine learning, computer vision, and network
design. I specifically enjoy studying how computer science and other fields
intersect with it, whether it be medical imaging or game theory, and I'm always
excited to work on projects that combine aspects from multiple fields.

Research
------
Currently, I'm working with [Anima Anandkumar](http://tensorlab.cms.caltech.edu/users/anima/),
[Yuanyuan Shi](http://shiyuanyuan.site/), and [Florian Schafer](https://f-t-s.github.io/) to
extend Competitive Mirror Descent to a multi-agent, reinforcement learning setting.

Previously, I've worked at the [Magnetic Resonance Systems Research Laboratory](https://mrsrl.sites.stanford.edu/)
at Stanford University under [Shreyas Vasanawala](https://profiles.stanford.edu/shreyas-vasanawala) and
[Ukash Nakarmi](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ukashnakarmi), working on the
development of a deep-learning framework to detect motion artifacting in
pediatric MRI and provide data informed suggestions to MR technicians.

I've also worked at [The Wall Lab](https://wall-lab.stanford.edu/) at Stanford,
under [Dennis Wall](https://profiles.stanford.edu/dennis-wall) and
[Nick Haber](https://ed.stanford.edu/faculty/nhaber) on developing a
machine-learning classifier for the diagnosis of Autism Spectrum Disorder
based on a patientâ€™s accuracy in emotional recognition and level of facial engagement.


Work Experience
------
I've interned at Google Brain as a Software Engineer on the
[TensorFlow Extended](https://www.tensorflow.org/tfx) team, working on an
end-to-end platform to automatically train and deploy ML models in production.
