excerpt: 'Wearable technology has presented a unique avenue of therapy for children suffering from non-neurotypical diseases. In this study, we aimed to test: (1) the feasibility of tracking gaze using wearable smart glasses during a facial expression recognition task for neurotypical and autistic children and (2) the ability of these gaze-tracking data, together with facial expression recognition responses, to distinguish children with autism from neurotypical controls (NCs).'
