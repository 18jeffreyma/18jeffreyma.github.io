First authored paper accepted to the IEEE International Symposium on Biomedical Imaging (ISBI'20).

MRI, an extremely expensive imaging modality, often suffers from a high degree of motion artifacting, which nececitates the need for some automated detection mechanism to avoid the inefficient use of high-cost radiologist labor to filter images. In this paper, we explore several convolutional neural network-based frameworks for medical image quality assessment and investigate several challenges therein.
