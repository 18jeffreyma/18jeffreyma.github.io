Summer 2020 - Mountain View, CA

I worked as a Software Engineering (SWE) Intern, on the
[TensorFlow Extended (TFX)](https://www.tensorflow.org/tfx)
team under the Google Brain org for Summer 2020.

Specifically, I worked on TFX,
an end-to-end platform for automatically deploying ML models in production, where
I implemented component improvements to support asynchronous component execution
and continuous pipeline architecture (i.e. supporting ML pipelines which can
periodically run and stay updated on continuously arriving batches of data).

In addition, beyond my assigned intern project, I explored native support for data
streaming data sources in TFX to satisfy a highly demanded use-case for TFX.
