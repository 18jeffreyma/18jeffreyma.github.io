Summer 2017, 2018 - Stanford, CA

Through the Stanford Institute of Medical Research Summer Research Program, I
worked as a Research Intern at [The Wall Lab](https://wall-lab.stanford.edu/), which
focuses on AI/ML solutions for non-neurotypical diseases. There, I worked to develop
a machine-learning classifier for diagnosing Autism Spectrum Disorder based on a
patientâ€™s accuracy in emotional recognition and level of facial engagement, working
to determine if a non-genetic evaluation could effectively diagnose autism.

My summer's work eventually culminated in a paper submitted and accepted to the Journal
of Medical Internet Research (JMIR), which is linked [here](https://www.jmir.org/2020/4/e13810/).

At The Wall Lab, I worked under [Prof. Dennis Wall](https://profiles.stanford.edu/dennis-wall)
and [Dr. Nick Haber](https://ed.stanford.edu/faculty/nhaber).
