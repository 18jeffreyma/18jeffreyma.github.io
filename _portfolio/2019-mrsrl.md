Summer 2019 - Stanford, CA

Through the Summer Undergraduate Research Fellowship program, at Stanford,
I worked at the [Magnetic Resonance Systems Research Laboratory (MRSRL)](https://mrsrl.sites.stanford.edu/) to
develop a machine learning framework to detect motion artifacting
in pediatric MRI and provide data informed suggestions to MR technicians, a problem
which would help reduce inefficent use of high-cost doctor hours on filtering
out poor MRI scans.

My work from this summer culminated into a first authored [research paper](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9098735) at
the 2020 IEEE International Symposium on Biomedical Imaging, for which I received
full funding (nearly two thousand dollars) to attend, through a competitive
application to the Patrick Hummel and Harry Gray Travel Fund and the George W.
Housner Student Discovery Fund.

At MRSRL, I worked under [Prof. Shreyas Vasanawala](https://profiles.stanford.edu/shreyas-vasanawala) (Radiology),
[Dr. Ukash Nakarmi](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ukashnakarmi/) (Electrical Engineering), and
[Chris Sandino](http://chrsandino.github.io/) (Electrical Engineering).
